# StudyTracker

StudyTracker tracks your time spent on studying subjects. You can add/remove your own subjects to your personal list and start recording. You can add study sessions (for example learning 25 minutes and resting 5 minutes). It gives you a auditive notification when learning and resting stages are due.

Note you need to restart the app so that changes take action (to be fixed).
